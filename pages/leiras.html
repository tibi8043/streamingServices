        Here's a simple way you can find out just how much information is being changed or lost
        when you compress an audio file. So first I'm gonna open up Adobe Audition, but you
        don't have to use this specific piece of software to do any of this. Second, I have an MP3 and
        a lossless version of this clip here. What I'm going to do is extract the mathematical
        difference between the two using a really simple technique I discovered. First, we need
        to line up the two tracks here. MP3s always have gaps at the beginning and end, so it's
        very important to do this. When aligning tracks in this program, it's very important to make
        sure it's exactly the same place, because otherwise it's not gonna work. At all. See
        in this one I got pretty lucky, but some songs like classical music don't always have like
        really big drum hits, so you can't always line up the audio very well. Or easily, at
        least - you need to it a hundred percent perfectly or else this is not going to work. Last thing
        I'm going to do is apply an inversion effect to one of the tracks. Doesn't matter which
        one, since the results are going to be identical. Now I'm gonna export the whole thing and check
        the results. before playing the track, I can immediately see that there's quite a bit of
        data here. If the files were really similar, there wouldn't be this much to listen to.
        if they were identical, it'd be literally a flat, silent waveform. In the spectrograph,
        we can see that there's a lot of noise until about here, when there's a lot of audio that
        wasn't in the MP3. Here's what the MP3's spectrograph looks like. And here's the original file's
        spectrograph. Let's just listen to the lossless version first. Then the MP3.
        Now let's go normalize the difference waveform and hear what it sounds like.
        Wow, that really is all you're missing when you listen to an MP3.
